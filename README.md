# Maestro

A multi-agent coordination framework for Minecraft, evolved from the Baritone pathfinding system.

Maestro extends beyond single-agent automation to enable cooperative behavior, shared world understanding, and
coordinated task execution across multiple autonomous agents.

## Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Supports Fabric, Forge, NeoForge, and Tweaker platforms.

## Credit

This project is a derivative work based on [Baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone) by leijurv and

with multi-agent abstractions.
